**Space Minesweeper** designed by Professor Evan Suma Rosenberg.

Despite appearing like a classic sci-fi-themed shoot-em-up, in which the player controls a spaceship and must avoid and destroy mines that are hurtling towards them, but it differs from other entries in the shoot-em-up genre in one major way: 'Each time the player fires a laser, they lose 50 points.' This mechanic was introduced in order to encourage accuracy and resourcefulness with how the player fires shots, rather than encouraging the player to fire a constant stream of lasers.

The player can move their ship in different directions by moving their cursor around the screen. The speed at which the ship will move is proportional to the distance between the cursor and the ship. The player can fire lasers out of the ship's rear gun by clicing their mouse or by pressing the space bar.

All the while, explosive mines will spawn around the screen and move towards the ship. The must move to avoid these mines, and shoot them to its path. If a mine is hit by a laser, the mine is destroyed, and the player scores 100 points. Then, four more lasers are shot out by the mine as it explodes, which can then hit other mines and spark chain reactions. These additional lasers shot from mines do not cause any point penalty to the player, meaning that a well-executed chain reaction can earn the player hundreds of points while only costing 50 points to fire one laser from the ship.

Whenever the ship is hit by a mine, the ship's shield bar at the bottom of the screen is depleted by one eighth. When the ship is hit by a mine after its shield bar is fully depleted, the game is over and the player cannot score more points. Whenever mines collide with each other, they explode, but do not launch any lasers.

The speed at which the mines move towards the ship increases as the player's score increases. Can you get past Rhett's personal score record of 10000 points?
