This browser-based app is my extension of the assignment
**Artistic Shading** designed by Professor Evan Suma Rosenberg.

This app allows the user to view various models of 3D object that are shaded according to various shader programs that were written for this assignment. The user can also select various textures to add to these models, which are also shaded according to the written shaders.
If you want to see a cool model, try selecting the "Normal Mapping" shader, and view a bunny model with the stained glass texture.
