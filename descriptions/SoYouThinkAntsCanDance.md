This browser application is my extension of the assignment
**So You Think Ants Can Dance** designed by Professor Evan Suma Rosenberg.

This assignment focuses on making character models to animate movements from motion capture data, all of which was made freely available by the [CMU graphic lab](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/). The app opens to a background resembling a dance
studio, with a single character in a still position. The user can use the "character type" menu to switch between viewing the character as an Ant, a crude skeleton of the different bones tracked in the motion capture data, or an illustration of the axes of the differnt bones tracked in the motion capture data. The user can use the "Dance Scene" change to change between viewing a single character doing ballet, a pair of characters salsa dancing, or four characters playing various sports.

Animations do not start playing until the user has clicked "Play/Stop Animation". When in the ballet studio, the user can click on the "queue ballet motion" buttons to queue different ballet motions to play.

My extension to this assignment was adding animations to add a screen in which the user can view characters doing motions from four different sports. These motions include shooting a basketball, kicking a soccer ball, boxing, and throwing a frisbee.
